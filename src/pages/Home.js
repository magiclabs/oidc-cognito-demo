              In the root directory of your React app, install the AWS Amplify
              library by running the command{" "}
              <code>npm install aws-amplify</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, install the AWS Amplify React library by running the command{" "}
              <code>npm install aws-amplify-react</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the root directory of your React app, create a new file called
              "aws-exports.js". Copy the following code into this file,
              replacing the values with your own:
              <CodeBlock text={awsExports} />
              Replace the placeholders with your actual values, which you can
              find in your Cognito console and AppSync console.
            </li>
            <li>
              In your app's "src/index.js" file, import the following:
              <CodeBlock text={importAmplify} />
            </li>
            <li>
              Initialize Amplify by adding the following code to the same file:
              <CodeBlock text={amplifyInitialize} />
            </li>
            <li>
              To display the Amplify UI Authenticator component, add the
              following lines of code to the application's entry point file
              (App.js):
              <CodeBlock text={authenticator} />
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, start your app by running the command{" "}
              <code>npm start</code> in your terminal. Your app should now be
              configured to use AWS Cognito for authentication.
